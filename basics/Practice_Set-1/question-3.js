//create a const object in javascript and add a new key to the const object 

const a1 = {
    name: "krrish",
    section: 1,
    isPrincipal: false,
}
    a1["friend"] = "tishu"

// we can add a new key to a const object because the object itself is not changing, only the properties inside it are changing.
